## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

The first first thing I do each morning is solve a Codewars challenge! 

## Optimizations

I am consistently refactoring and optimizing my code. Sometimes for efficiency and sometimes for readability. 

## Lessons Learned:

The biggest lesson I learned through these challenges is understanding that there is always room for improvement and a creative way to get the job done. I have learned the most from the challenges I could not solve on the first try, which was a fair share! I always make the effort to add these questions to my ANKI deck and review them before starting a new coding challenge, the next day.
