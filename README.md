A repository filled with my codewars challenges (kata).

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** <img src="https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=|&message=JAVASCRIPT&color=3c7f5d&style=plastic&logo=javascript"/>

Everyday, the first thing I do is solve a Codewars challenge! 

## Optimizations

I am consistently refactoring and optimizing my code. Sometimes for efficiency and sometimes for readability. 

## Lessons Learned:

The Biggest Lesson I learned through these challenges is understanding that there is always room for improvement and a creative way to get the job done. Not being able to answer a question is okay, as long as you take the initiative to improve.
